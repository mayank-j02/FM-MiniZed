## Experiment 1: Create the Interrupt Application Project

1.	File -> New -> Application Project -> LED_Dimer_w_Int, change BSP to use existing standalone_bsp_0 -> Next -> Empty Application -> Finish.
2.	Right click on src folder and click import -> General Item -> File System -> Next -> Browse and select the folder witch application code, select main.c and click Finish.
3.	Connect the board to your laptop.
4.	Project Explorer -> LED_Dimmer_w_int -> Run As -> Launch on hardware (System Debugger).

## Experiment 2: Add Interrupt Support to the Application

1.	LED_Dimmer_w_Int -> src -> main.c -> add imports.
2.	And also add definitions to map our interrupt setup routine.
3.	Declare variables, brightness will be declared globally.
4.	Add a code under variable declarations, this will act as a call back function.
5.	Add a function near line 89 which provides setup needed to enable the PWM interrupt to be recognized and attaches PWNIsr() as interrupt handler.
6.	Initialize brightness to 0.
7.	Add a call to SetupInterruptSystem() near line 164.
