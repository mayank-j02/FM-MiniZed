## Experiment 1: Create a Standalone BSP and an Application for the HTU21D Pmo

1.	System.mss -> Peripheral drivers -> “axi_iic_2iic” -> documentation.
2.	File -> new -> application Project -> “HTU21D” -> Next -> Empty Application -> Finish.
3.	HTU21D -> src -> Import.
4.	General -> File System -> Next.
5.	Browse -> Ok -> /home/training/AvnetTTC/ZynqSW/2019_1/Support_documents/Lab11 -> Select All -> Finish.

## Experiment 2: Hardware Setup to Run HTU21D Pmod Application

1.	Boot mode switch SW1 to JTAG mode.
2.	Disconnect the MiniZed board.
3.	Connect you HTU21D Pmod to Pmod 2 connector on MiniZed.
4.	Set the COM port to active COM setting and set the Baud Rate to 115200.
5.	Xilinx Tools -> Program FPGA -> Program.

## Experiment 3: Run and Explore HTU21D I2C Pmod Application

1.	Right click on HTU21D -> Run As -> Launch on hardware.
2.	Expand src and the six files will be visible.
