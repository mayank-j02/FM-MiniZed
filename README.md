6.	Important: Donâ€™t forget to select the Serial Port in the SDK Terminal before running any application.

## Enabling and Mapping all PS Peripherals
1.	In Block design, go to MIO configurations in the navigation pane.
2.	Check the QSPI checkbox, and check Feedback Clock under it and choose MIO 8 as I/O
3.	If using Ethernet map into EMIO otherwise check USB0 and enable it. But to set a Reset option, select GPIO -> USB Reset and expand it and set USB0 Reset to MIO 7. 
4.	Cross check the peripherals enabled in the Block diagram.

## Setting PS and PLL clocks
1.	In the block design window, select Clock config in the Page Navigator panel.
2.	Make sure the QSPI peripheral uses the IO peripheral as its clock source. Set the QSPI input clock to 200MHz.
3.	Change SDIO to 25MHz
4.	(IF youâ€™re using an PL, then enable the following
    â€¢ FCLK_CLK0 to 100 MHz
    â€¢ FCLK_CLK1 to 150 MHz
    â€¢ FCLK_CLK2 to 50 MHz
    â€¢ FCLK_CLK3 to 25 MHz
    Keep PL Fabric Clocks disabled if youâ€™re not using any PL)
5.	Click OK and Validate the Block DesignðŸ—¹. Save Progress.
6.	Under Design Sources, right- click and select Reset Output Products (   )

   4.	Set AXI Narrow Bursts to Manual and Select OK.
   5.	When any changes are made to the BLock Design View, if Designer Assistance is available, Select Run Connection Automation and select All automation. (This allows the software to make automatic connections based on the presets and preferences set).
 
__B.__ (Connecting to PL. Must enable Fabric Clock)
   1.	In the Zynq Overview block Diagram, click on PS-PL Config ->GP Master Axi Interface -> M AXI GP0 Interface. (Remember we had disabled this earlier as we had no PL to connect to).
   2.	In Clock Config, Set Fabric Clock -> FCLK_CLK0 to 50MHz.
      (As we have enabled PL settings, THE PS block has PL connections.)
   3.	Run Connection Automation. Make sure to check All Automation.
   4.	Cross check if the following connections have been made:
       â€¢	BRAM Controller S_AXI to AXI Interconnect M_AXI
       â€¢	 AXI Interconnect S_AXI to PS7 M_AXI
       â€¢	 PS7â€™s FCLK_CLK0 in 6 locations
       â€¢	 PS7â€™s FCLK_RESET0_N to the Processor System Reset
       â€¢	 Processor System Reset then resets the AXI Interconnect and BRAM Controller
   5.	Validate Design ðŸ—¹
   6.	Double click on the block design to view their properties.
   7.	Save the design and Reset and then generate the Output Products by right-clicking on the
