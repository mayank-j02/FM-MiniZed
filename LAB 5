## Experiment 1: Setup Hardware and Download Bitstream

1.	Connect the MiniZed USB-JTAG/UART port J2 to your PC, make the JTAG and serial port available to the Virtual Machine by right clicking on the USB Icon and selecting Xilinx JTAG + Serial option. 
2.	Set the COM port and Baud Port to 115200. In SDK set Xilinx Tools -> Program FPGA.
3.	SDK will already know the correct .bit file since this was imported with the hardware platform. 
4.	Click Program. 
5.	When the DONE LED lights blue, the PL has configured successfully. Look for the message “FPGA configured successfully with bitstream” in the SDK log. 

## Experiment 2: Running an Application

1.	Run the hello world and test memory application on the MiniZed, right click on Hello_Zynq Application Run As -> Run configuration. 
2.	Then Double click on Xilinx C/C++ Application.
3.	Ensure the connection type is set to Standalone Application Debug. 
4.	Make sure both Run ps7_init and Run ps7_post_config are enabled. 
5.	Ensure the application is set to download your desired application. 
6.	Then go back to SDK and click on Run.

## Experiment 3: Debug an Application

1.	Right click on Test_peripherals pplication and select Debus As, then select Debug configurations. 
2.	Then select Xilinx C/C++ Application then click on the new icon. 
3.	Then click on Debug. 
4.	Then click on Yes to confirm the perspective switch. 
5.	Make Sure GTK Term is Closed at the bottom of the SDK screen, select the SDK  Terminal tab.
